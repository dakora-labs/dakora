## Overview

The Dakora Studio is a hosted web experience for:
- Authoring and versioning templates
- Managing prompt parts and includes
- Viewing execution timelines and analytics
- Generating API keys and managing budgets
- Running prompt optimization (when enabled on your plan)

## Access

- Sign in with your account.
- Select a workspace and project (defaults provision automatically on first sign‑in).

## Key Workflows

- Create/Update Templates: Edit templates with input schemas, preview renders, and save versions. Roll back from version history.
- Parts Library: Manage reusable snippets, include via `{% include 'part_id' %}`.
- Executions: Inspect runs, drill into detail/hierarchy, and review normalized chat/tool timelines.
- API Keys: Create per‑project API keys for server‑to‑server use.
- Budgets & Analytics: Set monthly budgets, view daily cost trends and top templates by spend.

<Tip>
  Your first project is pre‑seeded with sample templates and parts. Look for them in the Templates and Parts panels and use them as a starting point.

## Authentication

Studio requires sign‑in. API requests from the Studio include JWTs automatically. For backends/integrations, use API keys.
