## Quick Example

Render a template with the Python SDK:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from dakora_client import Dakora

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()


async def main():
    # uses env vars: DAKORA_API_KEY and DAKORA_BASE_URL
    # initialize Dakora client
    dakora = Dakora()

    # Render a Dakora template and run it through the agent (auto-tracked)
    faq_template = await dakora.prompts.render(
        "faq_responder",
        {
            "question": "What is Dakora?",
            "knowledge_base": "**Dakora** is an open‑source AI observability and prompt management platform that delivers real‑time cost analytics, policy controls, and a hosted studio to help teams make every token count. Learn more at https://dakora.io.",
            "tone": "helpful",
            "include_sources": True,
        },
    )

    print("Rendered template:\n\n", faq_template.text)


asyncio.run(main())
```
