# Invitation redirect URL (where users land after clicking invite link)
# Leave empty to use Clerk's default Account Portal sign-up page (RECOMMENDED for most setups)
# This ensures users are properly authenticated and redirected after accepting their invitation
# Only set a custom URL if you have a custom sign-up page with Clerk's <SignUp /> component
# Production example: https://playground.dakora.io (Clerk will handle the /sign-up routing)
# Development: Leave empty or use http://localhost:5173 if testing custom sign-up flow
