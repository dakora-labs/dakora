  Code Formatting Guidelines:
  - Use markdown code blocks with language identifiers (```python, ```javascript, etc.)
  - Include inline code with backticks for short snippets
  - Add comments to explain complex logic
  - Follow language-specific conventions (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)
  - Include example usage when demonstrating APIs or functions
  - Keep examples concise but complete enough to run
